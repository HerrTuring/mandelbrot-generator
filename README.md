# Mandelbrot Generator

## Description

This project is just a simple console C++ aplication that after run outputs a mandelbrot fractal to a file called "mandelbrot.bmp".

Since this was coded with no optimizations nor multi-threading, the calculator takes quite a long time to end its work.

This was originally coded by demand for Dave Fashenpour on 2019.

## Usage

Just open the Visual Studio project in any version after 2019 and it should probably work as expected (last tested with VS 2022), and then just compile and run.

Then leave the computer and do something else, it will take a while. It does have constant feedback of what it is doing, so you will know when it is done.
